      Product Description
    </h3>
    <p>
      ShortSounds is an Android application that allows users with absolutely no experience to record, mix, and add effects to tracks.  To begin creating a ShortSounds, a user simply records a sound and then adds any desired effects with the simple, intuitive interface.  The user can repeat this process to add more and more tracks to their ShortSounds, adjusting effects and volumes as they go, until they create their desired finished product.  After the user creates the perfect masterpiece of blended and manipulated sounds, they can share their creation with their friends or save their sound in the application’s library to come back to and listen to or edit later.  This application is unique because it is simple and intuitive to use, allowing even individuals with no experience to easily create a sounds to share with all of their friends.

      Conceptual Models
    </h3>
    <p>
      A ShortSound is essentially a compilation of separate tracks that each have their own effects.  In order to demonstrate this concept, each track within a ShortSound has its own separate pull-down view, where effects can be added and adjusted.
    </p> <p>  
      Effects are designed to be as intuitive as possible, modeled as a graph where changes along the x axis affects one variable, and changes along the y axis affect the other variable.
    </p> <p>
      The ShortSounds library is modeled after other software music libraries, with all of the ShortSounds in a list, along with a share button and a play button for each individual sound.
    </p>

      ShortSound Workflow
    </h3>
    <p>  
      If a user wishes to create a new ShortSound, the user will first record a track.  After that, the user has the option to add effects to the track or record another track.  Effects can always be added or adjusted later after recording new tracks as well.  After recording and editing as many tracks as desired, the user will save their ShortSound to the ShortSound library to listen to, share, or edit later.
    </p> <p>  
      If a user wishes to edit a previously created ShortSound, the user would select the desired ShortSound from the ShortSound library.  Then the user could either add or remove tracks from the ShortSound or add effects to the current tracks in the ShortSound.  The user could then save and/or share the edited ShortSound.

      How to use the software
    </h3>
    <p>
      To begin, open up the application on your Android device.  
    </p>
    <h4>Record a Track</h4>
    <p>  
      The application’s home screen should have the words “RECORD A SOUND” and a recording button.  To begin recording, press the button.  The timer immediately under the button will let you know how long you have been recording.  When you are finished, press the recording button for a second time to stop the recording.  After you have recorded your track, the screen will look like the second phone diagram in the top row of Figure 1.
      <p>
        * It is recommended that you use headphones when recording multiple tracks. This will prevent one track from catching audio elements of another track. 
      </p>
      <p>
        * Certain android devices actually disable the phones default microphone. If you try to record with headphones and it does not appear to be recording sound, and the headphones do not have a built in microphone, you might have one of these devices. Unfortunately, there is no solution for this problem.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h4>Add effects to a Track</h4>
    <p>  
      After you have recorded a track, there will be options for different effects to add in a box, as seen in the second phone diagram on the top of Figure 1.  If you have more than one track recorded, the tracks will be shown in layers as seen in the first phone diagram on the bottom of Figure 1.  Touch the layer of the track that you wish to edit.  Pick one of the different effects options, and a screen will be displayed with either knobs or a graph to adjust the different components of the effect.  For example, if Reverb was the selected effect a graph would pop up as seen in the third phone diagram on the bottom of Figure 1.  Simply move the point to adjust echo and length.  After you click save (or cancel), you may press the white triangle play button near the bottom of the track to hear how the track sounds with the effect you are adding.  Alternatively, if you wish to hear how the whole ShortSound sounds with the effect that you are adding, you can press the play button on the bottom left of the screen.  Now, you can toggle the on/off switch by the effect to turn the effect that you have just adjusted on or off for the track.  From here, you can either add another effect to this track or another track, record a new track, save your ShortSound to your library, or share your ShortSound.
    </p>
    <h4>Rename a Track</h4>
    <p>
      Tapping the track's title will present a dialog where you can change this.
    </p>
    <h4>Seek to Position in Track</h4>
    <p>
      Once one or more tracks are recorded, it is possible to select a position from which you would like to start playback. To do this, you simply click or drag the indicator on the seekbar located on the lower toolbar. The leftmost side of the seekbar represents the start of the tracks, the rightmost indicator represents the end of the tracks. If you are currently playing tracks, it will pause and you will have to hit play again. When you hit play, it will play from that position. 
    </p>
    <h4>Delete a Track</h4>
    <p>
      To delete a track, there is a "swipe to delete" funcionality. Simply swipe the track's title left or right until the track dissapears.
    </p>
    <h4>Rename a ShortSound</h4>
    <p>
      To rename a ShortSound, tap the menu option in the upper right corner of the screen.  Select the rename option.  A dialog box will appear.  Type in your desired name (something other than just whitespace) and click okay and the ShortSound will be renamed.  Click cancel and the ShortSound will retain its name.
    </p>
    <h4>Load a ShortSound From Your Library</h4>
    <p>  
      In order to view your library, click the drawer icon in the upper left corner.  The library will appear, as shown in the bottom left phone diagram in Figure 1.  Once you decide on a ShortSound to work on, simply tap the name of the ShortSound to load it.  From here, you can either record a new track to add to your selected ShortSound, add effects to the tracks, share your ShortSound, or save your ShortSound.
    </p>
    <h4>Create a ShortSound</h4>
    <p>
      If at any point, you would like to create a new ShortSound, simply click the menu button in the upper right corner and select new.
    </p>
    <h4>Share a ShortSound</h4>
    <p>  
      To share a ShortSound, you must first load the ShortSound from your library (or already have your ShortSound open).  Then click the share button in the upper right corner and select the share option.  You will be given a list of different options of platforms on which to share your file that your ShortSound is saved on, including via Facebook Messenger and email.  Select your choice and share!
    </p>
    <h4>Delete a ShortSound</h4>
    <p>
      To delete a ShortSound, you must have it open.  Then, click the upper right menu button and hit delete.  Your ShortSound will be deleted, and the top ShortSound in your library will open.  If this was the only ShortSound in the library, a new Untitled ShortSound will be created and opened when the last ShortSound is deleted.
